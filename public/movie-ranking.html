 <h1>My Best Movies</h1>
 <h2>My top three movies of all times.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Dunkirk</h3>
 <p>Beautiful use of non-linear time and space, all presenting the same plot.</p>

 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
 <p>The corn field chasing scene and the use of the famous theme music blends together so well to create nostalgia.</p>

 <h3>Spiderman: Homecoming</h3>
 <p>The discovery of a young actor Tom Holland. I like pretty much like all the new Spiderman series.</p>
